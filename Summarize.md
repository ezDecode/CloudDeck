# Summarize 1

1. **"Cannot access 'handleConnect' before initialization" error:**
  * We identified a timing issue in `CredentialManager.jsx` where `handleConnect` was being 
    called before it was fully initialized within a `useEffect` hook.
  * We adjusted the `useEffect` dependency array to include `handleConnect` and ensured the 
    `useEffect` was correctly structured to avoid this temporal coupling.

2. **"Layout is broken, no styles were applied" (CSS issue):**
  * We diagnosed a potential conflict with App.css and removed the file from 
    `X:/CloudDeck/frontend/src/App.css`.
  * We verified that Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `index.css`) and its 
    usage in `App.jsx` and `CredentialManager.jsx` were correct.
  * To ensure a clean state and proper Tailwind processing, we performed the following 
    steps:
    * Deleted the dist folder (`X:\CloudDeck\frontend\dist`).
    * Reinstalled project dependencies (`npm install` in `X:/CloudDeck/frontend`).
    * Rebuilt the project (`npm run build` in `X:/CloudDeck/frontend`).

The core of the CSS issue was that Tailwind CSS was not being processed by the 
development server, which requires running `npm run dev`. However, Node.js compatibility 
errors with the AWS SDK were preventing the application from running properly.

**Final Solution:**
  * Added Node.js polyfills to fix AWS SDK compatibility issues:
    * Installed `util` and `buffer` packages as polyfills
    * Updated `vite.config.js` with proper alias configuration and optimizeDeps
  * Started the development server (`npm run dev`) which now runs successfully on 
    `http://localhost:5174/`
  * The application now loads properly with all Tailwind CSS styles applied
