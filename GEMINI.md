This document outlines the high-level plan for redesigning the user interface of the application, focusing on modernizing its look and ensuring responsiveness across various devices.

## Goals
- Modernize the overall aesthetic of the application.
- Ensure the UI is fully responsive and provides an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Improve user experience through intuitive layouts and clear visual hierarchy.

## Phase 1: Setup & Core Styling
- **Review Existing UI:** Analyze current components, layouts, and styling to identify areas for improvement and potential reuse.
- **Design System Foundation:**
    - **Color Palette:** Define a contemporary and accessible color scheme.
    - **Typography:** Select modern, readable fonts and establish a consistent typographic scale.
    - **Spacing & Sizing:** Implement a consistent spacing system and define responsive sizing for elements.
- **Responsive Design Principles:**
    - Utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid for flexible and adaptable layouts.
    - Implement media queries to adjust layouts and component styles for different screen sizes.

## Phase 2: Component Redesign (Iterative Approach)

### Authentication Page
- **Simplified Layout:** Streamline the login/signup forms for a cleaner appearance.
- **Improved Form Elements:** Redesign input fields, buttons, and other form controls for a modern look and better usability.
- **Clear Feedback:** Enhance error messages and validation feedback for immediate user understanding.

### Dashboard
- **Logical Information Organization:** Structure content with clear visual hierarchy, making key information easily discoverable.
- **Modular Design:** Utilize card-based or similar modular containers for distinct sections of content.
- **Responsive Navigation:** Redesign primary and secondary navigation elements (e.g., sidebar, top bar) to be intuitive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### File Explorer Components
- **Modernized Appearance:** Update the visual style of components such as `Breadcrumb`, `ContextMenu`, `FileItem`, and `FileList`.
- **Consistent Iconography:** Ensure all icons are clear, modern, and maintain a consistent visual style throughout the application.

## Phase 3: Refinement & Optimization
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Ensure the redesigned UI adheres to accessibility best practices (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize images, fonts, and CSS/JS delivery to ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions.
- **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Thoroughly test the redesigned UI across various browsers and devices to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.
